I looked on the forum to see how to easily delete the steps, miles, floors, and calories so my data would be accurate.  The only way people are fixing it is by manually logging the activity \"Automobile or light truck (not a semi) driving\" and entering in the duration.

And how does it automatically know the calories burned when everyone burns calories when they are sedentary at different rates.

For example, I have to manually specify my Sleep Goal (time asleep in hours/minutes), and separately I manually specify my Target Sleep Schedule by entering Bedtime and Wake up Time.  Whatever you enter for Target Sleep Schedule isn\\'t in any way connected to your sleep goal.   My suggestion is to make the app more helpful by incorporating logic to the Target Sleep Schedule functionality in the app in order to help you meet your sleep goal.  Specifically, the app should be able to calculate the Target Sleep Schedule Bedtime after you enter your Time Asleep Goal and Wake up Time.   For example: Let\\'s say I set my Time Asleep Goal to 8 hours of sleep per night.  I specify my Target Sleep Schedule Wake up Time as 7:00am. On average looking at my sleep data I spend roughly 1 hour per night restless/awake.   It should be smart enough to automatically calculate what time you should go to bed in order to meet your sleep goal.  The formula is very simple:  Wake Up Time - (Time Asleep Goal + Avg Time Awake/Restless)   Using my specific example above, I specify a Time Asleep Goal of 8 hours, and my sleep data suggests I spend an hour on average restless/awake each night.  That means I need 8+1 = 9 hours of time in bed in order to meet my Time Asleep Goal of 8 hours.  If I specify 7:00am as my Wake up Time, then to calculate Bedtime would be 7:00am - 9 hours = 10:00pm the night before. This means in order to meet my sleep goal for the night, I need to be in bed no later than 10pm. The app should be smart enough to automatically calculate 10:00pm as my Sleep Schedule Bedtime instead of forcing the user to manually do the math to figure out their sleep schedule.', 'My idea is that the fitbits should be kinetic.

There is a large library of svg objects that use mostly 'path' elements to define them freely available on the web. By adding support for this, we could create a richer user experience.   It would also be easier to use 'path' elements to draw certain objects that currently require image files (e.g. images of a heart, footsteps, stairs etc.). Image files also use more memory than would be required by an equivalent svg 'path' definition.   Svg 'path' is also more flexible than an image. For example, there are currently two 'heart' images in Fitbit OS. One is a solid heart while the other is a heart outline. Both of these could easily be reproduced using a single svg path element and changing a single attribute to switch between a solid or outline heart.   Svg elements can also be scaled and rendered any size without losing quality. Currently, if you want differently sized images, you will either have a 'large' image that is then scaled down to the required size, or several differently sized images.

Should be under SDK. Fixed.)   I'd like my Ionic apps to be able to send notifications to FitBit's standard notification queue. I'm suggesting a two-part solution:   (1) Allow apps to register a background process function that the FitBit device calls on a regular basis, even when the app is not running. The app would indicate its desired wake-up frequency, but FitBit might want to set a maximum wake-up frequency to limit resource usage.   (2) Allow apps to drop messages into the notification queue that FitBit displays above the clock face. This allows apps to provide notifications without having to write a phone app to push them, which would further clutter the phone's own notification queue.   The max wake-up frequency would determine the kinds of apps that users could write. Once-an-hour wake-up would allow apps to provide reports or reminders. Once-every-N-minutes wake-up would allow apps to monitor progress and make suggestions or provide encouragement. Once-every-minute (or faster) would allow apps to provide real time notifications. Absent this feature, app developers are forced to write their own clock apps to provide app notification services, even when a novelty clock isn't the point of the app. Alternatively, app devs could write mobile phone apps that issue app notices to the FitBit watch, but this clutters up the phone's notification queue. At present, this latter approach also requires round-tripping between the phone app and an Internet server in order to communicate with the companion.   Also, it's ideal that the app be able to do this without the phone (companion) present, so that people can rely on the FitBit without having to always have the phone around.

Presently we must tailor another exercise program, but there is no tracker for calories burned, step adjustment, etc. Tailoring “Walk” gives a step counter and time, but no way to adjust stride. SOLUTION: step length, step counter, then 4-5 resistance or intensity levels, length of time at each level, or average intensity. Incorporate arm activity in intensity.    Presently I have no reason to upgrade to Versa.  Perhaps this could be a separate waterproof device that syncs to dashboard.

He is amazing in the way he is handling his new life challenge.   I recently asked Fitbit if they had a program to donate appropriate devices to such individuals to help them with recovery and motivation.
